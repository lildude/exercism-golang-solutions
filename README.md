# My Exercism Go Solutions

I'm levelling up _my_ programming skills by taking on the little [exercism](http://exercism.io) [Go challenges](https://exercism.io/tracks/go). I'm saving them to this repo for posterity and so I can come back and reference them in future, just in case I come up with some Ã¼ber cool and amazing solution that I may want to refer back to.

If _you_ want to level up your programming skills, I highly recommend [exercism](http://exercism.io), just don't look at my solutions until you've solved them for yourself.

## Notes to self

- Fetch: `exercism download --exercise=<name> --track=go `
- Tests: `go test`
